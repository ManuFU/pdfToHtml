Perceptions of the Impact of Negatively Valued Physical
Characteristics on Social Interaction
Robert E. Kleck and Angelo Strenta
Dartmouth College
Individuals were led to believe that they were perceived as physically deviant
in the eyes of an interactant. Following a brief discussion, they commented on
those aspects of the interactant's behavior that appeared to be linked to the
deviance. The experimental arrangements were such that the interactant did not,
in fact, perceive them as deviant. Persons who thought that they possessed
negatively valued physical characteristics found strong reactivity to the deviance
in the behavior of their interactant, whereas those with a more neutrally valued
characteristic did not. An expectancy /perceptual bias explanation was advanced
to account for these results, though experimental demand could also be viewed
as a plausible interpretation. Study 2 provided more definitive data on the de-
mand aspects of the instructions used in the first study and reaffirmed that both
the expectancy and the demand explanations were plausible. Study 3 used a new
set of instructions explicitly devised to permit a test of the competing explana-
tions. In addition to replicating the important findings of Study 1, the results of
Study 3 in combination with those of Study 2 strongly undermine a demand
interpretation of the original results. In a fourth study, persons who had ob-
served the behavior of the interactants in Study 1 via videotape also perceived
greater reactivity to an imputed negative form of deviance than to a neutral
one. Data from this last study support the notion that the results of Studies 1
and 3 reflect the operation of an expectancy /perceptual bias mechanism and
tend to rule out a self-fulfilling prophecy dynamic.
It is now well established that negatively whether we choose to affiliate with them or not

(1971), for example, argues that in attempting
to arrive at some understanding of human
action, the naive perceiver uses what he labels
the principle of covariation. To the greatest
possible extent, the perceiver systematically
varies situations, people, and stimuli and ob-
serves when an effect in question occurs. When
it comes to understanding the impact of a
physical characteristic such as a missing arm
on the behavior of others, the physically
deviant individual is, however, at a particular
disadvantage. That is, he or she cannot vary
the presence or absence of the physical char-
acteristic to test for its effects on others. In
any face-to-face encounter, the characteristic
is potentially implicated as a cause of the
behavior of others, simply because it occurs
in contiguity with those behaviors. Physically
deviant individuals can still apply the prin-
ciple of covariation to persons, and to the
extent that their interactants treat them differ-
ently, they could conclude that the character-
istic is not implicated. Interestingly enough,
laboratory studies have shown that at least in
initial encounters, the variability in behavior
across physically normal individuals is less
when they are interacting with a physically
deviant person than when they are interacting
with one who is physically normal (Kleck,
1968, 1969; Kleck, Ono, & Hastorf, 1966).
Attribution theory aside, we have little
systematic evidence that persons who are
physically deviant perceive this deviance as
causally implicated in the behavior of others.
The purpose of the first study reported in the
present article, therefore, is to examine the
likelihood that persons who possess deviant
physical characteristics will see links between
those characteristics and the behavior of an
interactant. This question is examined under
conditions in which the characteristic can, in
fact, have no direct impact on the other's
behavior. Thus, at some level, the experiment
constitutes a test of Wright's (1960) proposi-
tion that physically deviant individuals will
perceive a relationship between how they are
treated and their physical characteristics, even
when such a relationship does not objectively
exist. The specific hypothesis being tested is
that if the physical characteristic at issue is
negatively valued (epilepsy or a facial scar),
it will more likely be implicated in an inter-
actant's behavior than if it is not stigmatizing
(an allergy). The initial study also sought to
explore the specific aspects of an interactant's
behavior that would be attended to by a
physically deviant individual when attempting
to assess the nature of the impact of the devi-
ance on an interactant's behavior. It was
tentatively hypothesized that a person with an
obvious physical defect (facial scar) would
tend to focus on the gaze behavior of an
interactant, whereas someone with a non-
obvious physical defect (epilepsy) would attend
to nonverbal and verbal indicators of anxiety
and tenseness.
Study 1
Method
Subjects. Subjects were 25 females enrolled in a
coeducational college in the northeastern United States.
Ten were unpaid volunteers from an introductory psy-
chology course, and IS were paid subjects recruited
from campus dormitories. One subject had to be
dropped, because she did not consent to have the scar
material applied.
Confederates. Each subject interacted with one of
two persons who were presumed to be subjects like
themselves. These two college-age females interacted
with subjects in each of the experimental conditions
described below. They were blind concerning the pur-
poses of the study, the experimental manipulations,
and the dependent measures. They were told only that
they would be discussing a particular topic with a
number of students and that part of their task was to be
behaviorally consistent across the various interactions.
Procedure. When subjects arrived at the laboratory,
they were given a set of written instructions that
randomly assigned them to one of three conditions:
allergy, epilepsy, or facial scar. These instructions in-
formed them that they would be involved in a discussion
with another female student and that the experimen-
ter's interest was in whether that person's behavior
would be affected by the physical condition attributed
to them.
All subjects then completed a biographical question-
naire, which they presumed would be exchanged with
the person with whom they were to interact. For the
allergy and epilepsy groups, the second page of the
questionnaire asked subjects to list any significant
aspects of their medical history. The experimenter
asked them to write either "a mild allergy that is under
drug control" or "a mild form of epilepsy that is under
drug control," depending on their random assignment
to experimental conditions. The confederates actually
saw only the first page of biographical information.
Subjects in the facial scar condition were asked if a
cosmetic preparation used to simulate facial disfigure-
ment in dramatic productions could be applied to their
face. As this material dries, it gives the appearance of
PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND SOCIAL INTERACTION 863
a healed scar, the size and extent of which can be
controlled by the application procedures. The scar was
placed on the subject's right cheek between the ear
and the corner of the mouth and was of a size to be
clearly noticeable in face-to-face interaction. The ex-
perimenter gave the subject a small hand mirror to
confirm that an authentic-looking scar had been placed
on her face. As she put the mirror down, he informed
her that he would have to put a moisturizer over the
scar to keep it from cracking and peeling off. In the
process of "moisturizing" the scar, the experimenter
removed it without the subject's knowledge.
After cautioning subjects not to talk about their
allergy, epilepsy, or facial scar unless the other person
mentioned it, the experimenter then brought the con-
federate, who was in a waiting room down the hall,
into the room where the interaction was to take place.
Two chairs were placed near the center, and the
confederate always took the same seat. The subject,
who had come from an adjacent room, was asked to
take the other chair, and both were told that additional
instructions would be played to them over the speakers
placed along one wall. The speaker cabinets also con-
tained video cameras and microphones, which per-
mitted the making of candid records of the interaction.
The experimenter then went to an adjoining control
room where he turned on the videotape equipment and
the tape recorder, which contained the remaining in-
structions. These instructions specified the discussion
topic (strategies people use in making friends) and
asked the two participants to begin their interaction.
The confederates had been instructed to initiate all
discussions with the same comment but to not dominate
the interaction.
After approximately 6 minutes, the experimenter
entered the room and asked both individuals to return
to separate rooms and complete the questionnaires that
had been placed there. The questionnaire asked the
subject to rate the confederate's behavior on five
dimensions: amount of eye contact, degree of tenseness,
amount of talking, degree of perceived patronization,
and amount of liking for the subject as a person. In
addition, she was asked to estimate how attractive the
confederate found her to be and whether the con-
federate would have been more comfortable with a
closer or more distant seating arrangement. All ratings
were done on 14-point bipolar scales.
When the subject had completed this form, she was
told that she and the other individual had been video-
taped and was asked to sign a release agreement
allowing her part of the videotape to be viewed by
others. The subject was then given the opportunity to
view and comment on the videotape made of the other
interactant's behavior. A split-screen recording format
had been used, and the side of the video monitor on
which the subject appeared was masked so that she
could see only her interactant (the confederate). She
was first shown a brief segment of the interaction to
familiarize her with the format and then saw and heard
(over earphones) the entire interaction sequence. She
was instructed to comment as the tape was played, on
any aspect of the other person's behavior that she felt
was responsive to the manipulated physical state (i.e.,
scar, allergy, or epilepsy), and her comments were tape-
recorded. The experimenter reiterated that the manipu-
lation may or may not have had an effect and that
the subject should not feel compelled to find effects
where none were evident.
At the conclusion of this commentary, the subject
was asked to summarize her comments in writing and
make any additional observations. The general nature
of the research was explained to her, and any questions
that she had concerning the procedures were answered
in detail.
Results
The first set of dependent measures was
derived from the verbal and written descrip-
tions that subjects gave of the confederates'
behavior. The verbal commentaries were tran-
scribed and appended to the written summary.
Two judges, unfamiliar with the general pur-
poses of the study or the specific physical
characteristics manipulated, rated each de-
scription on the extent to which the person
giving it felt that the physical state attributed
to them had affected the confederate's be-
havior. These ratings were made on a 14-point
bipolar scale, and the reliability across the two
judges for the entire sample was .85. An analy-
sis of variance based on the average judge
rating assigned to each subject revealed a
significant treatment effect, F(2, 21) = 10.43,
p < ,001. Individual comparisons showed that
scar and epilepsy condition subjects were both
judged to have made statements reflecting a
greater impact of their characteristics on the
confederates than were allergy subjects, ^(14)
= 4.62, p < .001, and /(14) = 3.28, p < .01,
respectively. Scar and epilepsy were not differ-
ent from each other.
A preliminary content analysis of the com-
mentaries suggested that only comments con-
cerned with gaze behavior (e.g., eye contact,
looking, watching) and tenseness (e.g., un-
comfortable, nervous, jittery) occurred with
a frequency meriting statistical analysis. The
experimenter and another person unfamiliar
with the study independently coded the sub-
jects' comments for the frequency with which
these behaviors were seen as responsive to the
manipulation of physical state. Interrater re-
liability coefficients were .98 for the gaze
measure and .99 for tenseness. Analyses of
variance of these frequency counts revealed
significant overall treatment effects for tense-
ness, F(2, 21) = 3.72, p < .05, and for gaze,

F(2, 21) = 5.61, p < .02. Between-groups com-
parisons on the tenseness measure demon-
strated that epilepsy subjects used such terms
more frequently in describing the confederates'
behavior than did allergy subjects, /(14) =
2.33, p < .05, but no other comparisons were
significant. The same comparisons for the gaze
measure revealed a significant difference only
between the scar and allergy groups, <(14)
= 3.3, p < .01, with the former making more
references to gaze behavior than the latter.
A multivariate analysis of variance, col-
lapsed across confederates, was conducted for
the seven dimensions on which subjects rated
their interactant immediately following the
encounter. This analysis yielded a significant
main effect for experimental groups, ^(14, 30)
= 2.95, p < .01. Univariate analyses of vari-
ance conducted for each dependent measure
demonstrated significant main effects for tense-
ness, F(2, 21) = 15.59, p < .0001; attraction,
F(2, 21) = 8.95, p < .002; and liking, F(2, 21)
= 3.41, p = .05. Specific between-groups com-
parisons for these three measures revealed the
following pattern of results: Scar and epilepsy
subjects perceived the confederate as signifi-
cantly more tense than did allergy subjects,
/(14) = 6.08, p < .0001, and <(14) = 4.29, p <
.001, but scar and epilepsy groups did not
differ from each other. Likewise, both scar and
epilepsy subjects perceived that the confeder-
ate found them less attractive than did the
allergy subjects, /(14) = 3.79, p < .01, and
/(14) = 2.26, p < .05, though on this measure,
the scar and epilepsy groups themselves dif-
fered, with the former rating themselves as
less attractive to the confederate, <(14) = 2.26,
p < .05. The significant main effect for the
liking measure was contributed to primarily
by the epilepsy subjects, who perceived that
they were liked less well by the confederate
than did the allergy subjects, <(14) = 3.19,
p < .01. As the means in Table 1 show, the
scar group perceived a level of liking by the
confederates that was midway between the
epilepsy and allergy subjects' perception,
though not significantly different from either
group.
The univariate analyses revealed no signifi-
cant effects for the remaining four measures.
An inspection of Table 1 does show, however,
that the pattern of means for these other
measures is generally consistent with the con-
clusion that scar and epilepsy subjects per-
ceived their conditions as having a more nega-
tive impact on the confederates' behavior and
disposition toward them as people than did
allergy subjects.
Discussion
The general pattern of results is consistent
with our hypothesis that a negatively valued
physical characteristic is perceived by its
possessor as having a greater impact on the
behavior of an interactant than one that is
not negatively connoted. Further, there is
some evidence suggesting that the type of
physically stigmatizing condition involved will
affect the aspects of the other individual's
behavior that are scrutinized for evidence that
the physical deviance is being responded to.
In the present case, for example, individuals
who thought that they had a scar were more
likely to focus on the gaze behavior of their
interactants, whereas those who thought that
the other attributed epilepsy to them were
sensitive to behaviors indicating tenseness and
anxiety.
These results are obviously consistent with
an expectancy notion. Subjects presumably
entered the experiment anticipating how others
might respond to various forms of physical
deviance and, when placed in interaction with
a peer, readily found evidence consistent with
these expectations. A questionnaire study
(Kleck & Strenta, Note 1), using subjects
PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND SOCIAL INTERACTION 865
drawn from the same population as the experi-
ment reported above, confirms that physically
normal individuals do have clear expectations
concerning the impact of various physical con-
ditions on dyadic social interaction. Parallel to
the findings reported here, individuals thought
that a physically normal individual, when
interacting with either a facially scarred person
or a paraplegic in a wheelchair, would (a) be
more patronizing, (b) find the individual less
attractive, (c) be more tense during the inter-
action, and (d) tend to prefer relatively large
interaction distances. When the physical con-
dition was an allergy, perceivers expected it to
have little if any impact on social interaction.
Although an expectancy explanation thus
appears reasonable, we do not know whether
the perceptions of the other individual's be-
havior were a direct function of what our
subjects thought they would find or whether
such thoughts served to modify the subjects'
behavior, which in turn altered that of the
confederates, with the modification being ac-
curately reported by the perceiver. That inter-
personal expectancies can have an impact on
the behavior of others is now well documented
(e.g., Snyder & Swan, 1978), and in the light
of this robust phenomenon, we made a strong
effort to control our confederates' behavior
and kept them blind to the experimental hy-
potheses and conditions.
To further assess the possibility of confeder-
ate behavior differences as a function of sub-
ject expectancy, two independent female
judges, age peers of our subjects, viewed the
confederate's portion of the videotape for each
of her interactions separately and rated her
behavior on the dimensions that had been
used as dependent measures for the subjects.
Since interjudge reliabilities were quite low
(.52 for the tenseness dimension being the
highest), separate multivariate analyses of
variance were conducted for each judge to
determine if either could successfully discrimi-
nate the experimental conditions. Though the
overall multivariate tests were far short of
significance in both cases, univariate analyses
were nevertheless conducted to see if either
judge was successfully discriminating experi-
mental conditions on any measure. Consistent
with the multivariate findings, none of the
individual tests approached significance.
As noted earlier, the scar and allergy manip-
ulations of Study 1 were selected in part be-
cause questionnaire data (Kleck & Strenta,
Note 1) suggested that persons expected the
former to have important effects on interaction,
whereas the latter was viewed as relatively
trivial. Epilepsy was chosen as the third condi-
tion, because it, like facial deformity, is a
negatively valued form of deviance (e.g.,
Kleck et al, 1968) but is nonobvious in much
the same way as an allergy. Further, the allergy
and epilepsy manipulations could be accom-
plished by the substitution of either term in
otherwise equivalent instructions given to
subjects. The scar manipulation on the other
hand, involved the complex process of applying
makeup to the subject's face, giving her an
opportunity to view the scar in a mirror, and
then removing it without her awareness. To
some extent, therefore, the epilepsy condition
provided a helpful control for the various
conceptually irrelevant differences that of
necessity existed between the scar and allergy
conditions.
Given the direct parallels between the allergy
and epilepsy manipulations, it appears reason-
able to interpret the results as being a function
of differential expectations that subjects had
regarding the impact of these conditions on
social interaction. The possibility exists, how-
ever, that the subjects themselves did not have
clearly articulated differential expectations but
attributed such expectations to the experi-
menter and were, therefore, simply acting con-
sistently with perceived experimenter "de-
mand." The fact that the study utilized a
between-subjects design in which individuals
were not aware of the other cells (physical
conditions being manipulated) undermines
such an interpretation, though not completely.
In Study 2, we attempted to provide more
direct data on experimenter demand by having
individuals read the instructions that had been
given to subjects in the allergy and epilepsy
conditions in Study 1 and then respond to
questions concerning their perceptions of the
experimenter's hypothesis, as well as stating
their own expectations regarding the likely
outcome of the study. For comparison pur-
poses, a third set of instructions was prepared,
which was intended to more explicitly and un-

Study 2
Method
Subjects and procedure. Fifty male and female college
students from an introductory psychology course were
randomly assigned to one of three experimental condi-
tions. In each of these, subjects were given written
instructions that they were told had been employed in
a previous experiment that sought to explore the effects
of a physical health condition on social interaction
outcomes. These instructions placed them in the subject
role of Study 1; they thought that the person they
were to interact with had information regarding a
health problem that they were experiencing (i.e., an
allergy or epilepsy). The point of Study 1 as conveyed
in these instructions was to have the subjects in that
study assess the extent to which the imputed physical
condition affected the other individual's behavior
toward them.
When they had finished reading the instructions,
subjects in Study 2 were asked to rate on a 7-point
scale (a) the degree of impact that they thought the
experimenter anticipated the imputed physical condi-
tion would have on the other individual's behavior and
(b) the degree of impact that they personally felt such
a physical state would have.
Experimental materials. The same instructions that
had been used in Study 1 for the allergy and epilepsy
manipulations constituted two cells of the present
design. In both sets of instructions, the sentence most
likely to affect perception of the experimenter's hy-
pothesis was, "The question as to whether or not the
other subject will behave differently toward you be-
cause he/she thinks you have an allergy (epilepsy) is
an interesting but unstudied one." To provide a condi-
tion that would be less ambiguous regarding the experi-
menter's hypothesis and against which responses to
these two sets of instructions could be compared, the
above sentence was modified to read, "The question
as to whether or not the other subject will behave
differently toward you because he/she thinks you have
an allergy is an interesting one and recent data we have
collected suggest that the other subject's behavior will
be different." This will subsequently be referred to as
the allergy demand condition.
Results and Discussion
Table 2 shows the means for the subjects'
ratings of what they thought the experimenter
expected regarding the impact of the inde-
pendent variable (physical condition) and what
they personally expected the study to find.
Consistent with our findings in Study 1,
persons reading the epilepsy instructions re-
ported that they expected a greater impact on
another's behavior than did subjects reading
either version of the allergy instructions, t(32)
= 3.8, p < .001, for allergy versus epilepsy;
<(30) = 3.54, p = .001, for allergy demand
versus epilepsy. At the same time, however,
persons in the allergy condition perceived that
the experimenter expected this variable to have
less of an impact than did persons in the
epilepsy condition, t(32) = 2.04, p < .05. Sub-
jects in the allergy demand group did not
differ from epilepsy subjects in their attribu-
tions of experimenter expectation.
These data, rather than resolving the issue,
leave open the possibility that the results of
Study 1 are amenable to either an expectation
or experimenter demand explanation, or per-
haps some combination of the two. The data
are helpful, however, in that they serendipi-
tously provide the materials for a more defini-
tive test of the two alternative explanations.
The allergy demand instructions had been
written to provide a condition for which sub-
jects would have little difficulty inferring that
the experimenter expected his manipulation to
have an impact. The means in Table 2 reveal
that this was indeed the outcome and that
subjects perceived that the experimenter in
the allergy demand condition expected as ro-
bust an effect as did the experimenter in the
epilepsy condition. What is important, how-
ever, is that subjects in the allergy demand
cell projected a hypothesis upon the experi-
menter (he was perceived as expecting high
impact), which they themselves did not share
(they expected relatively little impact), /(15)
= 5.57, p < .0001. Thus, the allergy demand
condition and the epilepsy condition were
PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND SOCIAL INTERACTION 867
equivalent in terms of perceived experimenter
demand but very different in terms of sub-
jects' expectations. If individuals' responses in
the paradigm of Study 1 were a function of the
inferred experimenter's hypothesis, then the
allergy demand instructions should have gen-
erated results parallel to those found for the
epilepsy condition of that study. If, on the
other hand, subjects' own expectations were
the important variable, the allergy demand
instructions should have resulted in data
parallel to the original allergy condition in
Study 1. In Study 3, the allergy and epilepsy
manipulations of Study 1 were replicated
precisely, and the allergy demand instructions
were included as a third condition.
Study 3
Method
Subjects. Subjects were 30 females from the same
population as those used for Study 1. Fifteen were
unpaid volunteers from an introductory psychology
course, and 15 were paid subjects recruited from
campus dormitories.
Confederates. Two college-age females served as
confederates, and each was randomly paired with half
of the subjects in each of the three cells of the design.
The confederates were unacquainted with the subjects
with whom they interacted and were blind to the
purposes of the study, the experimental manipulations,
and the dependent measures.
Procedure. When the subject arrived at the labora-
tory, she was given a set of written instructions that
randomly assigned her to one of three conditions:
allergy, allergy demand, or epilepsy. Throughout the
experimental session, the experimenter was kept blind
to the particular cell assignment of each subject,
though he was familiar with the general nature of the
research. The instructions informed the subject that
she would be placed in a conversational encounter with
another female student and that the experimenter's
interest was in whether that person's behavior would
be affected by a physical condition that was to be
imputed to the subject.
Biographical information was exchanged as in Study
1, to lead the subject to believe that the other person
perceived her as having an allergy or epilepsy. After
the exchange, the experimenter brought the two persons
together in the experimental room and told them that
additional instructions would be played over a speaker
in the corner of the room. This speaker concealed a
video camera focused on the confederate and a micro-
phone that was used to record the verbal exchange.
The experimenter moved to the adjoining control room
from which he played the tape-recorded instructions
and videotaped the confederate. As before, the instruc-
tions specified "strategies people use in making friends"
as the discussion topic.
Following approximately 6 minutes of interaction,
both individuals were asked to go to separate rooms to
complete a questionnaire. When the subject had com-
pleted this form, she was given the opportunity to view
and comment on the videotape of the confederate's
behavior. As in Study 1, she was asked to comment on
any aspect of the other person's behavior that she felt
was responsive to the medical information that had
supposedly been given prior to the start of the inter-
action. At the conclusion of the commentary, which
was tape-recorded, the subject was asked to summarize
her observations in writing and make any additional
comments. When she had finished writing, the experi-
menter consulted the subject's instruction sheet to
determine which condition she had been assigned to.
He then gave her the appropriate form containing the
two questions that had been the focus of Study 2, that
is, (a) what degree of impact she thought he anticipated
the allergy (epilepsy) would have on the other person
and (b) what her expectations had been regarding the
degree of impact of the imputed condition. The rationale
for the study was then explained to her, and any
questions she had concerning the procedures were
answered in detail.
Results
As in Study 1, the tape-recorded verbal
commentaries were transcribed and appended
to the written comments of the subject. Two
judges, unfamiliar with the previous research
and the general purposes of the present study,
rated each description on the extent to which
the person giving it felt that the physical con-
dition attributed to her had affected the other
person's (confederate's) behavior. As before,
these judgments were made on 14-point bipolar
scales, and the reliability between judges
across the entire sample of 30 protocols reached
an acceptable level, .73.
An overall analysis of variance based on the
average judge rating assigned to each subject
in each of the three conditions was highly
significant, F(2, 27) = 6.73, p < .005. The
mean ratings for each condition were 2.2, 2.45,.
and 5.0 for allergy, allergy demand, and
epilepsy, respectively. As might be expected
given this array of means, both allergy condi-
tions were significantly different from the epi-
lepsy cell, /(18) = 3.37, p < .005, and <(18)
= 2.52, p < .05, for allergy versus epilepsy and
allergy demand versus epilepsy, respectively.
A content analysis of the commentaries
similar to that conducted for Study 1 revealed
that references to tenseness and gaze behavior
occurred with sufficient frequency across proto-
cols to justify statistical analysis. Frequency

counts conducted by one judge and the experi-
menter for each of these categories were highly
reliable: .96 for tenseness and .98 for gaze
behavior. An overall analysis of variance of
the frequency of tenseness references was
significant, F(2, 27) = 3.7, p < .05, and sepa-
rate comparisons revealed that as with the
perceived impact data, the two allergy condi-
tions differed from the epilepsy cell but not
from each other, <(18) = 2.61, p < .05, for
allergy demand versus epilepsy; t = .0, ns, for
allergy versus allergy demand. An overall
analysis of the frequency of gaze behavior
references revealed that these did not dis-
criminate the experimental conditions, just as
they did not in Study 1.
As in Study 1, subjects completed a ques-
tionnaire that asked them to rate the con-
federate's behavior on seven dimensions:
amount of eye contact, tenseness, patroniza-
tion, amount of talking, liking, how attractive
the confederate found them to be, and whether
the confederate would have preferred a closer
or more distant seating arrangement. All
ratings were made on 14-point bipolar scales.
A multivariate analysis of variance involving
all seven measures, collapsed across confeder-
ates, did not yield a significant main effect for
experimental groups, thus precluding univari-
ate analyses of the dimensions separately.
Prior to debriefing, subjects were asked to
rate the expectations which they had had and
which they thought that the experimenter had
had at the start of the session regarding the
possible impact of the manipulation (allergy
or epilepsy) on the other individual's behavior.
This was done on the same 7-point scale used
in Study 2. Unlike the subjects in Study 2,
persons who had actually gone through the
procedures did not project differential experi-
menter expectations as a function of condi-
tions, F(2, 27) = .48, ns. This appears reason-
able in that once one has experienced the
relatively elaborate arrangements of the ex-
periment, it is difficult to believe that the
experimenter is expending all this effort for a
manipulation that he believes will not have
an effect. These responses could also be seen
to further obviate an experimenter demand
interpretation of the results, though since they
were taken at the end of the experiment rather
than prior to any interaction, they are some-
what problematic in this regard.
Subjects' own expectations regarding the
impact of the manipulation were precisely
parallel to those of subjects in Study 2. That
is, allergy compared to allergy demand sub-
jects did not anticipate a differential impact,
<(18) = 1.04, ns, whereas both allergy groups
differed from the epilepsy cell, /(18) = 1.81,
p < .10, and /(18) = 3.04, p < .01, for allergy
versus epilepsy and allergy demand versus
epilepsy, respectively. As in Study 2, persons
in the allergy conditions also perceived that the
experimenter expected a greater impact for the
manipulations than they did, £(18) = 3.58,
p < .01, and /(18) = 4.64, p =.001, for allergy
and allergy demand, respectively, whereas for
the epilepsy condition, this was not the case,
<(18) = 1.54, ns.
The results of Study 3 replicate those of
Study 1 in that a negatively valued physical
characteristic (epilepsy) is perceived by the
person to whom it is imputed as having a
greater impact on the behavior of an inter-
actant than is one that is not negatively
connoted (allergy). Further, these results, in
conjunction with those of Study 2, strongly
undermine the plausibility of a demand in-
terpretation of the results and offer additional
support for the expectancy notion advanced
earlier.
As noted when the expectancy hypothesis
was first advanced to account for the results
of Study 1, there are two plausible mechanisms
by which an expectancy might function in
this paradigm. If a person to whom a negative
characteristic has been imputed thinks it will
have an impact on others, then he/she may
modify his/her behavior in such a way as to
directly affect the behavior of the other. From
this perspective, the discrimination that our
subjects were making between the allergy and
epilepsy conditions could reflect real differ-
ences in confederate behavior created by a
self-fulfilling prophecy dynamic. On the other
hand, confederates may have been behaving
in much the same manner across conditions,
but subjects' expectations caused them to dif-
ferentially perceive or interpret this behavior.
A preliminary assessment of these two pos-
sibilities was conducted as part of Study 1 by
having naive judges view all of the videotapes
PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND SOCIAL INTERACTION 869
of the confederates in each of the three condi-
tions in that study and rate their behavior on
a number of dimensions. Though these judges
were unable to discriminate the conditions,
thus arguing against a self-fulfilling prophecy
mechanism, it should be noted that the judges
were uninformed regarding the experimental
conditions or arrangements. It could be argued
that one is less likely to detect true behavioral
differences, particularly if they are relatively
subtle, without knowledge of the situational
constraints that have created the differences.
Since our original subjects had direct knowl-
edge of those constraints, they may have been
better able to detect the impact of the vari-
ables on confederate behavior than were our
naive judges. The fourth study has as part of
its purpose an examination of this possibility,
using correctly informed and misinformed ob-
servers as subjects.
The primary purpose of Study 4 was to
assess whether observers of an interaction
perceive the impact of a deviant physical con-
dition on an interactant in a manner similar
to actors who think that they possess that
characteristic. It would be reasonable to ex-
pect, given the observers' more objective per-
spective on the interaction, that they would
be less inclined to see an impact where none
exists. At the same time, consistent with the
results of both Study 1 and our questionnaire
expectancy data, it was anticipated that ob-
servers would be less inclined to find behavioral
responses to an allergy condition than to a
facial scar.
Study 4
Method
Subjects. Subjects were 32 females drawn from the
same population used in the previous studies. Twenty
were volunteers from an introductory psychology
course, and 12 were paid subjects recruited from
dormitories.
Procedure. Subjects, who were tested individually,
were told that their participation required that they
be informed regarding a previous interaction between
persons of their own age. They were then handed a
description of this interaction, which randomly as-
signed them to either the allergy or scar condition. (The
epilepsy manipulation was not used.) This description
detailed the physical arrangements of the interaction,
specified the true topic of conversation, and indicated
how the experimental manipulation of physical condi-
tion had been achieved (i.e., biographical questionnaire
in the case of allergy and cosmetic material in the case
of facial scar). The subject was not told that the scar
had been removed prior to the start of the interaction
or that the allergy information had been deleted from
the biographical sketch shown to the confederate.
Subjects were told that they would be looking at the
videotape of one pair of subjects who had participated
in the previous study. As in the first study, one half of
the television monitor was masked so that the subject
could see only the confederate. The subject was in-
formed that this was being done to reduce the distrac-
tion that might otherwise be created and to allow her
to concentrate on the "normal" interactant.
The videotapes in the present study were those made
of the two confederates in the allergy and scar condi-
tions of Study 1. All of the tapes from both of these
Study 1 conditions were paired with a scar description
for one half of the subjects and with an allergy descrip-
tion for the other half. Thus, one half of our observers
had an expectancy consistent with those of the subjects
in Study 1, and the other half had expectancies incon-
sistent with them.
When they had finished viewing the tape segment,
subjects completed a set of self-report measures identi-
cal to those used in the first study. They also re-viewed
the videotape and verbally pointed out specific aspects
of the confederates' behavior, if any, that were respon-
sive to the manipulation of the physical state of their
interactant. As with the subjects in Study 1, they
summarized these observations in writing. Finally,
they were asked to respond to two questions: (a) "If
you were interacting with someone who was facially
scarred (had an allergy), how would you act so as to
make the person think the scar (allergy) did not affect
your behavior?" and (b) "In that interaction would
you acknowledge or mention the scar (allergy)? Why
or why not?"
As soon as the subject had completed her answers,
the experimenter questioned her on her perceptions of
the study and informed her of the deceptions involved.
Any questions that she had regarding the procedures
or the general research issues were answered in detail.
Results
The design of the study was a simple 2 X 2
analysis of variance in which observers were
led to believe that they were viewing tapes of
interactions involving someone with either a
facial scar or an allergy (tape description),
and this was crossed with whether the tape
actually involved a subject who thought she
had a facial scar or an allergy attributed to her
by an interactant (type of tape shown). Main
effects for tape description thus indicate that
observer expectancies are important, whereas
main effects for the type of tape shown suggest
that there are actual behavior differences in
the tapes that the observers were detecting
independent of their expectations. The pres-

ence of these perceived behavioral differences
would obviously support the notion that a
self-fulfilling prophecy mechanism had been at
work in Study 1 and that the scar and allergy
condition subjects in that study were behaving
differentially and thus eliciting different pat-
terns of behavior from the confederates.
The verbal and written commentaries were
used to derive the same measures as in Studies
1 and 3. Again, two judges unfamiliar with the
design of the study independently rated each
description on the extent to which it revealed
(in the observers' eyes) some impact of the
allergy or scar on the confederates' behavior.
The interrater reliability was .79, and the
average of the two judges' ratings was entered
into an analysis of variance. Though judges
tended to perceive the scar-described tapes as
resulting in greater impact than allergy-
described tapes, this tendency was only margi-
nally significant, ̂ (1, 28) = 3.15, p < .10. As
in Studies 1 and 3, the observers' commentaries
were content analyzed for all references to
gaze behavior and tenseness by the experi-
menter and an independent judge, with respec-
tive interrater reliabilities of .97 and .99. The
only significant effect for these two measures
was that observers who thought that they
were watching interactions involving a facially
scarred person made more references to the
confederates' gaze behavior as a probable out-
come of the condition than did observers
viewing persons with an allergy, F(l, 28)
= 30.94, p < .001. There were no significant
main effects or interactions involving type of
tape shown to the observer.
The observers rated the confederate and her
behavior on the same dimensions used by the
subjects in Studies 1 and 3, that is, amount of
perceived eye contact, tenseness, amount of
talking, degree of perceived patronization, her
apparent liking for her interactant, whether she
would have preferred a closer or more distant
seating arrangement, and how attractive she
found her interactant to be. A multivariate
analysis of variance of these ratings revealed
that whether the interaction had been de-
scribed to the observers as involving a scar or
an allergy made a difference, F(l, 22) = 3.94,
p < .01. In this analysis, there were no main
effects for type of tape shown and no signifi-
cant interaction between the description of the
tape provided to the observer and the cell of
the previous study (scar or allergy) from which
the tape had been drawn.
Univariate analyses for each of the seven
dependent measures revealed several effects of
borderline significance. For example, subjects
receiving the scar description rated the con-
federate as more tense than did those receiving
the allergy description, F(\, 28) = 2.88,
p < .10. As can be seen from the means for
these measures, given in Table 3, the general
pattern is for the scar to be perceived as having
a more negative impact on an interactant's
behavior and interpersonal disposition than
an allergy has.
Finally, responses to the questions (a) "How
would you act so as to make the person think
the scar (allergy) did not affect your be-
havior?" and (b) "Would you acknowledge or
mention the scar (allergy)?" were examined.
Consistent with the other findings, 13 out of
16 subjects in the scar condition responded to
Question a by suggesting that they would
carefully monitor their gaze behavior, ap-
parently because it was the most likely be-
havior to be perceived by the disfigured
individual as linked to the scar. Comments
such as, "I would try to look at her frequently,
as if there were nothing wrong," "I would try
to keep eye contact, not avoiding her face but
at the same time not staring at it," and "I
would attempt to meet her gaze and not avert
my eyes from either it or the scar" are repre-
PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND SOCIAL INTERACTION 871
sentative of this concern. Only two persons
in the allergy condition mentioned the need to
monitor gaze behavior and, in general, unlike
the scar condition subjects, persons in this
condition disavowed the need for a conscious
behavioral strategy. Comments such as, "It
(the allergy) wouldn't affect my behavior, and
I think I would feel perfectly relaxed around
her and just be myself" or "I don't think that
if a person did have an allergy I would act
any differently toward her" are representative
of this group.
Subjects in both conditions agreed (scar =
81%; allergy = 75%) that they would not
explicitly mention the other person's physical
failing unless that person brought it up. As
might be expected, the reasons given for not
initiating acknowledgment were quite different
across the allergy and scar conditions. Of those
persons in the allergy condition who stated
that they would avoid mentioning the issue,
six (50%) indicated that it was primarily
because the condition was "uninteresting" or
"irrelevant to the interaction." Only one
individual felt that explicit mention of the
allergy might generate embarrassment in the
conversation. Of the 13 persons who said that
they would avoid mention of a scar, on the
other hand, 8 (62%) alluded to the embar-
rassment and anxiety that would probably
follow from explicit acknowledgment.
Discussion
As expected, observers of a dyadic inter-
action perceived that if one member of the
dyad was facially scarred, this would have a
greater impact on the behavior of the other
than if that person had an allergy. Though
the general pattern of attributions made to the
"normal" interactant by the observers in Study
4 was similar to that made by the actors in
Study 1, the differences were clearly less
robust. Perhaps the most striking similarity
between the results of the two studies is that
persons who think one member of a dyad has
a facial scar (Study 4) or who think they
themselves have that scar (Study 1) are very
prone to see the gaze behavior of the normal
interactant as reflective of responsiveness to
the physical defect. It should be kept in mind
that subjects in both studies were female and
that there is some evidence that women are
more responsive to the gaze behavior of an
interactant than men are (e.g., Exline, 1963;
Kleck & Nuessle, 1968). Further, gaze be-
havior appears to be an aspect of the behavior
of others that we do not consciously attend to
in most situations and, therefore, have little
awareness as to what would constitute a normal
level and style of looking (Ellsworth & Ludwig,
1972). If for some reason our attention is
drawn to that behavior, we may conclude,
quite erroneously, that it is linked to a specific
aspect of our own person (as in Studies 1 and 3)
or to a physical characteristic of one member
of a social interaction (as in Study 4).
The results of Study 4 provide support for
the notion that we are working with a percep-
tual bias rather than a self-fulfilling prophecy.
That is, the different expectations that the
actors brought to their interactions with the
confederates in Study 1 did not appear to have
a direct impact on the confederates' behavior.
This conclusion is supported by the lack of a
main effect for type of tape in Study 4. Ob-
servers in this study saw no more evidence for
an impact of a facial scar on social interaction
when they were seeing a tape of an interaction
involving a person who thought that she had
a scar than when they saw a tape of an inter-
action involving a person who thought that an
allergy had been attributed to her. This is in-
direct evidence at best but is consistent with
the data reported in Study 1 suggesting that
judges could not discriminate differences in
confederate behavior as a function of the
nature of the expectancy that the confederate's
interactant brought to the conversational
interaction.
We have focused attention on this issue
because it has been repeatedly demonstrated
that how we expect others to behave can
directly affect their behavior (Snyder & Swan,
1978). From this perspective, the causal chain
would include these four links: (a) an expec-
tancy or hypothesis for how an interactant
will behave, (b) which leads to a change in
own behavior, (c) whereupon the change in
own behavior modifies the behavior of the
interactant, and finally (d) the change in the
interactant's behavior is perceived as con-
firming the expectancy rather than being
linked to the change in own behavior. We had
872 ROBERT E. KLECK AND ANGELO STRENTA
created a paradigm that we hoped would rule
out such a mediating mechanism, primarily by
keeping our confederates blind to the experi-
mental manipulations and by stressing the
need for constancy in their behavior. It is ob-
viously necessary to provide independent evi-
dence for the success of this strategy, and this
has been done in part through Study 4 and in
the independent judge assessment of con-
federate behavior in Study 1.
One could question the importance of ruling
out the self-fulfilling prophecy explanation for
the present results. Whether the tendency to
perceive a salient physical characteristic as
affecting the behavior of those who interact
with us is mediated by our own change in
behavior, which in turn has an effect on those
interactants, or is mediated by perceptual bias
on our part, the result is essentially the same,
that is, as physically deviant individuals we
find evidence that our deviance is important
to our social outcomes. Viewed from the per-
spective of the physically normal individual,
however, which process is at work clearly
could have quite different implications. If the
interactive outcomes I experience with physi-
cally deviant individuals are largely a function
of expectation-linked behaviors on their part,
I can consciously not respond to those be-
haviors or strive to disabuse the deviant indi-
vidual of his or her expectations and thus
break the expectation-behavior interactive
outcome cycle. If, on the other hand, it is
simply a case of perceptual bias, then no
matter what I choose to do, my behavior can
be causally linked to the physical defects of
the persons with whom I interact. Indeed,
subjects in the fourth study who suggested
that acting naturally was the best strategy to
avoid having one's behavior linked to the
physical failing of another nevertheless saw
evidence of responses to a physically deviant
characteristic in the "natural" responses of our
confederates.
It should be kept in mind that the paradigm
used in the first study is one in which persons
are led to believe that they are temporarily
deviant, and only in the eyes of one other
person. The leap from these results, therefore,
to the conclusion that they support Wright's
(1960) assertion that physically handicapped
persons are often prone to articulate their
social reality entirely in terms of their handi-
cap, even when the objective facts do not
support such a construction, is tenuous at
best. It is now necessary to demonstrate that
persons who are permanently physically devi-
ant make the same kinds of disability-linked
attributions to a natural stream of behavior as
did the subjects in the present studies. It is
entirely plausible that with some history of
interaction with others, a physically deviant
individual develops strategies for testing and
evaluating whether a specific behavior or
social outcome can be correctly attributed to
a physical failing. Research directed toward
this goal is now underway.
